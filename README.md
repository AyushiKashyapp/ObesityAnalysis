This study explores the social-structural foundations of obesity by investigating how individuals’ positions within their egocentric social networks influence body mass index (BMI). Previous findings suggest that individuals occupying a bridge position within their network get access to a variety of non-repetitive information which impacts their BMI.

The study is done using a multivariate analysis of nationally representative data on older Americans. It was found that occupying a bridging position within a network allows better access to health-related knowledge and impacts the likelihood of being obese. These findings highlight the significance of considering social network position and the role of individual connection in understanding the structural bases of health issues like obesity.

This study extends on a previous study by including more impactful features related to an individual’s critical health status and modelling them using logistic regression and decision tree, dimensionality reduction using t-SNE, and clustering using K-Means, providing a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and significant predictors of obesity. The interaction of personal demographic, social network, and critical health features offer valuable insights into health disparities and development of potential strategies for addressing obesity.
